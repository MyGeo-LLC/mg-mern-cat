# MERN Project

This project is a MERN stack application that includes a responsive, modular design with JWT authentication, role-based access control (RBAC), and real-time bidirectional communication capabilities. The project is set up for local development, building, and packaging for both Windows and Linux.

Steps for Development, Build, and Packaging
Development
Navigate to your project directory:

sh
Copy code
cd /path/to/mern-project
Run the start.sh script to start the database in Docker and run the backend and frontend locally:

sh
Copy code
./scripts/start.sh
Start the Electron app for development:

sh
Copy code
npm run electron-start
Build and Package
Navigate to your project directory:

sh
Copy code
cd /path/to/mern-project
Run the build_and_package.sh script to build and package the application on Linux:

sh
Copy code
./scripts/build_and_package.sh
Run the build_and_package.ps1 script to build and package the application on Windows:

powershell
Copy code
./scripts/build_and_package.ps1
Running Backend and Frontend Services Separately
If you want to run the backend and frontend services separately for more control during development, you can use the following commands.

Start the Database (MongoDB) in Docker
In one terminal window, navigate to your project directory and start the MongoDB service in Docker:

sh
Copy code
cd /path/to/mern-project
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
Start the Backend Server
In another terminal window, navigate to the backend directory and start the backend server:

sh
Copy code
cd /path/to/mern-project/backend
npm install  # Only needed the first time or when dependencies change
npm start
Start the Frontend Server
In a third terminal window, navigate to the project root directory and start the frontend server:

sh
Copy code
cd /path/to/mern-project
npm install  # Only needed the first time or when dependencies change
npm start
Summary
Run the start.sh script to start the database in Docker and run both backend and frontend locally.
Alternatively, run the services separately for more control by using Docker for the database and starting the backend and frontend servers manually.
By following these steps, you can develop your application locally with the backend and frontend running on your machine and the database running in a Docker container. This setup ensures a smooth development workflow while keeping the database environment consistent.
